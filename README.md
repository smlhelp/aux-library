# aux-library

## Overview
This repository contains an auxiliary library for Standard ML, meant as a supplement to the basis library of SMLNJ. The primary purpose of this library is to concretely demonstrate various principles of functional programming, such as the use of custom datatypes, higher-order functions, exceptions, modules, and so on. The modules contained in this library will (eventually) be fully documented and accompanied with other supporting materials. 

## Modules List
- `Timing`: Provide common utilites relating to date, time, and timing. _datatypes, higher-order functions, order_
- `Language`: Various combinators for `string -> bool` functions. _higher-order functions_
- `Regexp`: Regular expression matcher. _datatypes,continuation passing style, exceptions_
